## About the project
Book Library App Where you can see all the books available to borrow in addition to that reviews from other users for an individual book available in the libray. Also as Signedin user you can Reserce the book as well as you can post a re view for each book.

The project was to create a full-stack application by implementing a backend (SpringBoot/Java/SQL) front-end(React && TypeScript). The projects purpose is to demonstrate my ability to implement as a Full Stack Developer into TDD environment.

## User Stories

```
As a user 
You are able to see all the available books in a library

You are only able to reserve 5 books at a time

As a signed in user

```
## My Approach

Initially i have taken each user story as a requirement and break it down in to front end and backend requirements.

My approach is to start with the backend where i design my tables and constraints and insert the data and the run the query with the help of SQL workbench to see the datas are there as per expectation.

Then On Intellij I have created the Entities/Repositories /Service and controller for individual stories.

When my route(HTTP request) is created for a user story i have always checked on Postman.Once its successfully giving the desired result i have started with my Frontend part where my API is ready to work with.

With the Frontend Requirements i have designed my mocks UI and component Hirarchy to begin with.
